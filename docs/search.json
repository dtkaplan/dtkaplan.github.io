    "text": "Professional Summary\nMy career has spanned several periods: a biomedical-engineering period when I was involved in signal processing using emerging tools from nonlinear dynamics, a physiology period as a researcher and a teacher of pre-medical physiology and biology courses, a period as an applied-mathematics/computational-science educator which has segued into statistics, statistical modeling, data science, and machine learning. In each of these periods, I have developed texts and other learning materials across a variety of fields: introductory statistics, computational-statistics & data-science, introductory calculus (taught as an applied subject), computer programming, and epidemiology. Over the past 15 years, I have worked extensively with faculty from colleges nationwide to develop their professional and computational skills in teaching the core mathematics curriculum and statistics in a genuinely applied way. I have a national and international reputation for this work. This interview from the Journal of Statistics Education captures much of the motivation and philosophy behind this work.\nA constant throughout my career has been computation. I learned to program as a 14-year old and have worked professionally with a large variety of languages including (in roughly chronological order) BASIC, FORTRAN, APL, UNIX web scripting, C, Mathematica, C++, Scheme, MATLAB, and R, and the many auxiliary systems relating to typesetting, publishing, graphics, and websites. It can’t be known for sure, but I am likely the first person in North America to teach introductory statistics with R (starting 1997), and I was one of the earliest course developers in Mathematica (circa 1990)."

    "text": "Current projects\n\nStatistics\nLessons in Statistical Thinking (LST) is my attempt to encourage the statistics education community to rethink what ought to be taught in introductory statistics to prepare students for work in the 21st century. The standard intro course covers topics from the early 1900s, doesn’t engage modern computing, data science, or essential topics of causality. LST is a student-facing textbook that provides motivated instructors a path to move away from the standard intro course.\n\n\nApplied mathematics\nMOSAIC Calculus tries to fix a century-long problem in math education at the college level. Almost universally, calculus is taught in a manner that creates obstacles to students rather than insight and opportunity. The traditional (and still dominant) curriculum sprawls across four or five semesters, with the most important topics left to the end: functions of multiple variables, linear algebra, and dynamics. Only lip service is paid to modeling, one of the most important phases in using mathematics. Modeling refers to translating real-world situations into a mathematical representation that can be easily worked with to extract information and answers.\nTo become accessible and useful to students, the important topics and modeling should be covered from the start. Modern computational techniques should be used to avoid obscure algebraic manipulations. And meaningful connections should be made to data science and statistics.\nThe topics and techniques of calculus should be covered in a compact way that occupies only one or two semesters of a student’s time and do not rely on algebraic skills that mainstream students do not have and have never had. MOSAIC Calculus is a demonstration that this can be done."
