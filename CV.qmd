## Professional Summary

My career has spanned several periods: a biomedical-engineering period when I was involved in signal processing using emerging tools from nonlinear dynamics, a physiology period as a researcher and a teacher of pre-medical physiology and biology courses, a period as an applied-mathematics/computational-science educator which has segued into statistics, statistical modeling, data science, and machine learning. In each of these periods, I have developed texts and other learning materials across a variety of fields: introductory statistics, computational-statistics & data-science, introductory calculus (taught as an applied  subject), computer programming, and epidemiology. Over the past 15 years, I have worked extensively with faculty from colleges nationwide to develop their professional and computational skills in teaching the core mathematics curriculum and statistics in a genuinely applied way. I have a national and international reputation for this work. [This interview from the *Journal of Statistics Education*](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xd94rfyuwaprhbs/JSE-interview.pdf?dl=0) captures much of the motivation and philosophy behind this work.

A constant throughout my career has been computation. I learned to program as a 14-year old and  have worked professionally with a large variety of languages including (in roughly chronological order) BASIC, FORTRAN, APL, UNIX web scripting, C, Mathematica, C++, Scheme, MATLAB, and R, and the many auxiliary systems relating to typesetting, publishing, graphics, and websites. It can't be known for sure, but I am likely the first person in North America to teach introductory statistics with R (starting 1997), and I was one of the earliest course developers in Mathematica (circa 1990).
